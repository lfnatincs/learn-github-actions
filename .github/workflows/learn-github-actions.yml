## Optional
## The name of the workflow as it will appear in the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository.
name: learn-github-actions

## Optional
## The name for workflow runs generated from the workflow
## which will appear in the list of workflow runs on your repository's "Actions" tab.
## This example uses an expression with the github context to display the username of the actor that triggered the workflow run.
## For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."
## run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is learning GitHub Actions

## Specifies the trigger for this workflow.
## This example uses the push event, so a workflow run is triggered every time someone pushes a change to the repository or merges a pull request.
## This is triggered by a push to every branch;
## for examples of syntax that runs only on pushes to specific branches, paths, or tags, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

  AWS_REGION: ap-northeast-1 # set this to your preferred AWS region, e.g. us-west-1

## Groups together all the jobs that run in the learn-github-actions workflow.
jobs:
  ## Defines a job named check-bats-version. The child keys will define properties of the job.
  check-bats-version:
    ## Configures the job to run on the latest version of an Ubuntu Linux runner.
    ## This means that the job will execute on a fresh virtual machine hosted by GitHub.
    ## For syntax examples using other runners, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    ## Groups together all the steps that run in the check-bats-version job.
    ## Each item nested under this section is a separate action or shell script.
    steps:
      ## The uses keyword specifies that this step will run v3 of the actions/checkout action.
      ## This is an action that checks out your repository onto the runner, allowing you to run scripts or other actions against your code (such as build and test tools).
      ## You should use the checkout action any time your workflow will run against the repository's code.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      ## This step uses the actions/setup-node@v3 action to install the specified version of the Node.js (this example uses v14).
      ## This puts both the node and npm commands in your PATH.
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "14"

      ## The run keyword tells the job to execute a command on the runner.
      ## In this case, you are using npm to install the bats software testing package.
      - run: npm install -g bats

      ## Finally, you'll run the bats command with a parameter that outputs the software version.
      - run: bats -v
